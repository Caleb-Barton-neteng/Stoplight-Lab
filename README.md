# Stoplight Control Web App

This project is a **Flask web application** that controls a set of **LEDs on a breadboard** to simulate a traffic stoplight. It provides a simple interface to control the stoplight (red, yellow, green LEDs) through a web page. The LEDs are connected to a Raspberry Pi 5, and you can control the stoplight via HTTP requests.
